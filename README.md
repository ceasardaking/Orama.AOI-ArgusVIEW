ArgusVIEW
Computer Vision System for Tire Defect Detection
ArgusVIEW is an advanced AI-powered image recognition system designed to detect and classify tire defects with high accuracy. This repository contains trained ConvNeXt models, edge detection scripts (work-in-progress), and detailed release notes.
Overview
ArgusVIEW leverages deep learning techniques to automatically identify various types of tire defects that might be missed in manual inspections. The system uses ConvNeXt architecture optimized for both accuracy and performance in industrial settings.
Repository Contents

Trained Models: Pre-trained ConvNeXt models ready for deployment
Edge Scripts: Work-in-progress scripts for edge detection and implementation
Release Notes: Detailed documentation of version updates and improvements
Documentation: Usage guides and API references

Product Lineup

ArgusVIEW-T: Specialized for tire defect detection (current repository)
ArgusVIEW-I: Specialized for knee implant inspection (coming soon)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
python >= 3.11.8
torch >= 1.9.0
torchvision >= 0.10.0
opencv-python >= 4.5.3
openvino >= 2024.0.0

Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArgusVIEW.git
cd ArgusVIEW
pip install -r requirements.txt

Quick Start
from argusview import TireDefectDetector

# Load a pre-trained model
detector = TireDefectDetector('models/convnext_tire_v1.2.pth')

# Analyze an image
results = detector.analyze('path/to/tire_image.jpg')

# Display results
print(results.defects)
print(f"Confidence: {results.confidence}")

Model Performance
Current models achieve:

At least 95% accuracy on standard test sets
Average inference time of 45ms on NVIDIA T4 GPU
Support for 12 distinct defect categories
